# Random-Forest-Premier-Project
Premier Project for team Random Forest - Hamoye Internship

This github repo hosts the project deliverables required to pass STAGE C in the Hamoye Internship program.

Problem statement:
The problem is to predict to which country the new user of AirBnb will book his/her first travel experience.

Solution workflow:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Featurization and Encoding of Data
- Building the Model
- Model Evaluation & Iteration

Conclusion:
Working with our best model obtained (87.26% ndcg score), we were able to predict the top 5 most probable destinations for each user.

Future work:
- More features could have been extracted from the session data as well as train data, also other data sets like countries and age_gender_bkts can be used to build a new data set for training the model.
- More hyperparameter tuning on different parameters of the model can be done.
